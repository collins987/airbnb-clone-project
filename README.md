## 🔐 API Security\
Security is a critical aspect of the Airbnb Clone backend system to protect sensitive user information, ensure trustworthy transactions, and maintain system integrity. Below are the key security measures implemented:

### 1. **Authentication**
* **Purpose**: Ensures that only registered users can access the system.
* **Implementation**: Token-based authentication (using JWT or DRF tokens) to validate user sessions.
* **Why it matters**: Protects user accounts from unauthorized access and maintains session integrity across the platform.

### 2. **Authorization**
* **Purpose**: Restricts access to certain actions based on user roles (e.g., user, host, admin).
* **Implementation**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to limit user capabilities (e.g., only hosts can list properties).
* **Why it matters**: Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they do not own, ensuring privacy and integrity.

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
* **Purpose**: Prevents abuse of API endpoints (e.g., spamming login requests or brute-force attacks).
* **Implementation**: Throttling policies using Django REST Framework.
* **Why it matters**: Protects the API from being overwhelmed and helps mitigate DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.

### 4. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
* **Purpose**: Prevents malicious data from being processed or stored.
* **Implementation**: Form and serializer validations, including regex checks, required fields, and length restrictions.
* **Why it matters**: Blocks injection attacks like SQL injection or XSS, ensuring data integrity and application stability.

### 5. **Secure Payments**
* **Purpose**: Protects financial data and transaction records.
* **Implementation**: Integrate with a secure third-party payment provider (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) and use HTTPS for all transactions.
* **Why it matters**: Safeguards users' financial information and builds trust in the platform.

### 6. **HTTPS and SSL Encryption**
* **Purpose**: Encrypts data in transit between client and server.
* **Implementation**: Enforce HTTPS through Nginx or web server configuration and SSL certificates.
* **Why it matters**: Protects sensitive information like passwords and payment details from interception.

### 7. **Session and Token Expiration**
* **Purpose**: Ensures sessions and access tokens are short-lived.
* **Implementation**: Configure token expiration and automatic session invalidation.
* **Why it matters**: Reduces the risk of compromised credentials being reused.

### 8. **Audit Logging**
* **Purpose**: Tracks key user actions such as logins, bookings, payments, etc.
* **Implementation**: Store activity logs in a secure and immutable format.
* **Why it matters**: Aids in monitoring, debugging, and investigating suspicious behavior.

### 9. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Control**
* **Purpose**: Manages which frontend applications can interact with the backend.
* **Implementation**: Configure allowed origins using Django CORS headers.
* **Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized web apps from making requests to your backend.
